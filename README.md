# Tipsy-Tree
Networked augmented reality/accelerometer mobile game.

This is a 2 player game where each player requires a mobile device and Player 1 requires an image target. Player 1 controls a raccoon character through an augmented reality viewport, attempting to collect as many fruits as possible on a tree top. Player 2 controls the treetop by tilting their device, which also shows a top-down view of Player 1 and the tree. Player 2's objective is to knock Player 1 off the tree.
